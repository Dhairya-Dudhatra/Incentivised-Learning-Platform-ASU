# Gamification Platform Readme

## Project Overview

### Description

Gamification has become a popular strategy for increasing engagement and motivation in various contexts. This project aims to develop a web-based platform that enables instructors to easily implement gamification elements into their courses. The platform allows instructors to create courses, define tasks for students, assign points, maintain leaderboards, and set up a virtual shop where students can exchange earned points for perks.

### Requirements

#### 1. Course-specific Data
- Each course using gamification has its own set of students, shop items, leaderboards, and point balances.

#### 2. User Types
- **Students:** View currency balance, submitted tasks, earned currency per task, leaderboards, shop items, and purchase perks.
- **Instructors:** Create/view courses, add students, define shop items with prices, add tasks and associated point values, and assign points to students.
- **Admins:** Can perform all actions of instructors and view courses created by any instructor.

#### 3. Automation
- Automatically generate course leaderboards when point values change.
- Automatically tally earned points, allowing students to purchase shop items if they have sufficient points.

#### 4. Notifications
- Notify instructors when a student purchases a shop item, including course name, student name, item bought, and purchase date/time.

#### 5. Efficient Point Entry
- Instructors can enter points for each student for a selected task on a single page without reloading or selecting different students.

#### 6. Visual Style
- Dark and 8-bit game graphics/pixel graphic theme.

### Usage

1. **User Authentication**
   - Students, instructors, and admins must have separate login credentials.

4. **Admin Oversight**
   - Admins have access to all instructor actions and course information.

5. **Automation**
   - Leaderboards are automatically updated with changing point values.
   - Students can automatically purchase shop items when they have enough points.

6. **Notification System**
   - Instructors receive notifications when students purchase shop items.

7. **Efficient Point Entry**
   - Instructors can enter points for all students in a course on a single page without reloading.
