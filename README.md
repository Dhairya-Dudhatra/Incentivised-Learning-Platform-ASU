# Gamification Platform Readme

## Project Overview
Gamification of LMS

### Description

The platform allows instructors to create courses, define tasks for students, assign coins, maintain leaderboards, and set up a virtual shop where students can exchange earned coins for perks.

### Requirements

#### 1. Course-specific Data
- Each course using gamification has its own set of students, shop items, leaderboards, and point balances.

#### 2. User Types
- **Students:** View currency balance, submitted tasks, earned currency per task, leaderboards, and purchase perks.
- **Instructors:** Create/view courses, add students, define shop items with prices, add tasks and associated point values, and assign points to students.
- **Admins:** Can mangage instructor accounts.

#### 3. Automation
- Automatically generate course leaderboards when point values change.
- Automatically tally earned points, allowing students to purchase shop items if they have sufficient points.

#### 4. Notifications
- Notify instructors when a student purchases a shop item, including course name, student name, item bought, and purchase date/time.

#### 5. Efficient Point Entry
- Instructors can enter points for each student for a selected task on a single page without reloading or selecting different students.

#### 6. Visual Style
- Dark and 8-bit game graphics/pixel graphic theme.
